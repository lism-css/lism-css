/**
 * Ambient declaration for `lucide-react`, for the bundled viewer only.
 *
 * `@lism-css/mockup` does not depend on the real `lucide-react` package (45MB of icon
 * modules that npx would download on every run). The CLI resolves the specifier to a
 * virtual module built from `@iconify-json/lucide` instead (`src/vite/lucide-icons.ts`),
 * so the import stays exactly the same but there is no package on disk to read types from.
 *
 * The declarations users get are generated from that same icon data
 * (`src/vite/lucide-types.ts` → `types/lucide-react.d.ts`), which is where the full,
 * always-current list of ~4,000 icon names lives. This file is not that list: the viewer
 * is type-checked before the package is built, so it cannot depend on a build artefact.
 * It only has to cover what the viewer itself imports — when a viewer component starts
 * using another icon, add one line below and the compiler points straight at the name.
