Let me introduce the Reset CSS that I personally use.

<EmbedCode repo='lism-css/lism-css' branch='dev' srcPath='packages/lism-css/src/scss/reset.scss' />


The traditional purpose of CSS resets was to ensure consistency across browsers by resetting all default styles to a blank slate.

However, the CSS reset I use does not fully serve that purpose.

I follow these principles:
:::note
- Follow browser default styles as much as possible and keep the code to a minimum.
- Only address common layout issues and accessibility concerns in this stylesheet.
- Leave the base styles for each HTML tag to stylesheets loaded after reset.css.
:::


It might be a bit unusual that I don't reset `padding` to `0`, leaving it at the browser default.

I've made it possible to use just this reset.css standalone, so feel free to use it if you'd like.

```
