This site is a blog for outputting my personal knowledge about CSS.

I've adopted a documentation-style layout, and I'd like to develop this into a site where you can systematically learn about CSS.

- Knowledge cultivated through creating my own projects
- Updated versions of blog posts I've written in the past
- Information I've organized based on knowledge gathered from the internet

I will operate this site based on these sources.

It's been difficult to publish information as blog articles, but now that AI can quickly polish text into a style suitable for public consumption, I'd like to make use of that.

## About the Author

I'm a frontend engineer who develops and sells WordPress themes.

I used to run a frontend tech blog, but since most of the content became outdated, I closed it and launched this new site.

## Lism CSS

I've already published [Lism CSS](https://lism-css.com), which systematically organizes CSS design, including the knowledge introduced on this site.

https://lism-css.com

It's still in beta, so the specifications change frequently, but please take a look.

## Site Structure

Built with Astro + Lism CSS.

## About AI-Assisted Writing

I basically write everything myself, and all the code content has been verified by me before being published.

However, for editing work such as fleshing out the text and formatting, I sometimes get help from AI.  
(For parts generated or edited by AI, I confirm and revise the results myself before publishing.)

## Contact

If there are any errors in the content on this site, I would appreciate it if you could point them out.

Please send a mention to `@ddryo_loos` on X and I will check it.
